## Description

This code does common string replacements that can be used when converting JQuery to Javascript.

## Common Usages

### Light usage of JQuery

The reason for this is that sometimes JQuery is not needed, and can be removed. This would be done to possibly improve
the performance of sites that may not use JQuery Heavily.

### Base Library / Framework Change

Ruby on Rails removed the JQuery Library from their website and went with another library. This left many previous Ruby
sites stuck and having to remove the JQuery library or suffer the penalty of using two competing libraries at the same
time.

### Usage

Remove the textNrep.php DIE() statement. Modify it to handle your directory.

### Limitations

JQuery provides many features to Javascript that can not be simply removed. Therefor, it is encouraged to expect this
library to break your code.

Areas we most commonly see problems (but not limited to) are in null handling and other exception handling.
